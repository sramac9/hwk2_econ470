# Building the Data
Answer the following based on our initial, simplified dataset of enrollments, plan types, and service areas:

\noindent 1. How many hospitals filed more than one report in the same year? Show your answer as a line graph of the number of hospitals over time.

```{r}
#| echo: false


knitr::include_graphics("Q1.png")

```





\newpage
\noindent 2. After removing/combining multiple reports, how many unique hospital IDs (Medicare provider numbers) exist in the data?


```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("Q2.png")
```

\newpage
\noindent 3. What is the distribution of total charges (tot_charges in the data) in each year? Show your results with a “violin” plot, with charges on the y-axis and years on the x-axis. For a nice tutorial on violin plots, look at Violin Plots with ggplot2.


```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("Q3.png")
```

\newpage
\noindent 4. What is the distribution of estimated prices in each year? Again present your results with a violin plot, and recall our formula for estimating prices from class. Be sure to do something about outliers and/or negative prices in the data.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("Q4.png")
```

\newpage
\noindent 5. Calculate the average price among penalized versus non-penalized hospitals.

The average price among penalized hospitals is 9685.11. The average price among non-penalized hospitals is 9323.93.

\newpage
\noindent 6. Split hospitals into quartiles based on bed size. To do this, create 4 new indicator variables, where each variable is set to 1 if the hospital’s bed size falls into the relevant quartile. Provide a table of the average price among treated/control groups for each quartile.


```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("Q6.png")
```

\newpage
\noindent 7. Find the average treatment effect using each of the following estimators, and present your results in a single table:

Nearest neighbor matching (1-to-1) with inverse variance distance based on quartiles of bed size
Nearest neighbor matching (1-to-1) with Mahalanobis distance based on quartiles of bed size
Inverse propensity weighting, where the propensity scores are based on quartiles of bed size
Simple linear regression, adjusting for quartiles of bed size using dummy variables and appropriate interactions as discussed in class


\newpage
\noindent 8. With these different treatment effect estimators, are the results similar, identical, very different?


\newpage
\noindent 9. Do you think you’ve estimated a causal effect of the penalty? Why or why not? (just a couple of sentences)




\newpage
\noindent 10. Briefly describe your experience working with these data (just a few sentences). Tell me one thing you learned and one thing that really aggravated or surprised you.

Working with this data definitely has a learning curve. Because I am also using this dataset for my thesis analysis, I had some experience working with it previously, but even then the results of the clean data set can be difficult to produce. I do find it very interesting that
